              газа в страны Западной Европы на –16,3 млрд куб. м (–8,5%). Это объясняется заполненностью\n                  зарубежных ПХГ газом, относительно теплой зимой и низким спросом из‑за мер по предупреждению\n                  коронавирусной инфекции.</p>}\n                rightPart={<p>При снижении спроса со стороны стран-потребителей дальнего зарубежья за 2020 год\n                  фиксируется уменьшение поставки газа по ГТС в ближнее зарубежье на –1,7 млрд куб. м (–4,8% к 2019\n                  г.) — до 33,2 млрд куб. метров. Главным фактором снижения поставки в этом направлении является\n                  остановка поставок российского газа на Украину, объем которых в сравнении с 2019 г. ниже на –2,8\n                  млрд куб. м.

Следует отметить также влияние прошлогоднего запуска в эксплуатацию\n                  газотранспортного проекта «Сила Сибири», который показал существенный рост поставок газа в Китай на\n                  +3,8 млрд куб. м (в более чем в 11 раз к 2019 г.)</p>}\n            />\n            <MapTransport\n                className='page__leftItem page__wide'\n            />\n            <Heading\n                className='page__wide page__leftItem page__leftPadding pb-10  pb-s-2'\n                value='Экспорт сжиженных углеводородов'/>\n            <Heading\n                className='page__wide page__leftItem page__leftPadding'\n                type='small'\n                value='Отгрузка СУГ на экспорт'/>\n            <ul className=\"page__outputList page__wide\">\n              {supplyExportLiquidOutputList.map((item, i) => (\n                <li\n                  className=\"page__outputList-item\"\n                  key={`${item.title}${i}`}\n                >\n                  <Output\n                    type='small'\n                    config={[\n                      {\n                        title: item.title,\n                        value: item.value,\n                        measurement: item.measurement,\n                        isPositive: item.isPositive,\n                        percentage: item.percentage,\n                      }\n                    ]}/>\n                </li>\n              ))}\n            </ul>\n            <PartsContent\n                className='page__wide page__leftItem page__leftPadding pb-5'\n                leftPart={<p>В поставках за пределы таможенной территории РФ отгрузка в дальнее зарубежье снизилась на\n                  –1 776,5 тыс. т (–38,3%), в ближнее зарубежье — возросла на +23,1 тыс. т (+2,2%).
